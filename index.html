      <section id="about">
        <h2>üë§ About Me</h2>
        <p class="skills"> I graduated from Harvard in May 2025 with an SB in Mechanical Engineering. In my senior year, I was the head course assistant for ES183:
          Introduction to Heat Transfer, where I hosted office hours, graded assignments and quizzes, and helped students work through both. 
          During my time at Harvard, I was also part of the Automotive Society, where I co-led the aerodynamics team for our first Formula SAE car, and the 
          Rocket Propulsion Group, contributing to the design and testing of propulsion systems.
          <br><br>
          What I appreciated most about Harvard was the ability to explore beyond MechE. Some of my favorite courses were Intro to Electrical Engineering, 
          Ancient Chinese Philosophy, and Electronic and Photonic Devices.
          <br><br>
          Outside of engineering, I was a 400m sprinter on the varsity Track and Field team. 
          Balancing sport and school has taught me a lot about discipline, time management, and how to stay optimistic even when things get tough. 
          I‚Äôve also had the chance to compete internationally and take on leadership roles on the team, which has been just as rewarding as the engineering work. 
          My goal is to represent Team GB in the 400m/4x400m relay. Outside of track, I enjoy tennis, rock climbing and Formula 1.</p>
