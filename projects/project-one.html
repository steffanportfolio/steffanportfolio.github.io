        <p class="justify">My senior thesis focused on designing, testing, and validating the aerodynamic package for Harvard’s first-ever Formula SAE (FSAE) electric racecar. 
          As the Aerodynamics Co-Lead for the Harvard Undergraduate Automotive Society, I led the end-to-end development of key aerodynamic components including 
          the front and rear wings, undertray, diffuser, and side skirts. The goal was to improve high-speed handling, downforce, and stability without compromising 
          weight or manufacturability. I used SolidWorks for CAD modeling, integrated CFD simulations (via SimScale), and iterated through multiple design 
          prototypes based on real-world constraints such as material limits, team manufacturing capacity, and FSAE regulations. 
          The final aero package achieved a significant increase in predicted downforce and contributed to better handling and traction in dynamic events. 
          This project demonstrated not only technical engineering design but also cross-disciplinary teamwork and real-world prototyping under strict time and 
          resource constraints.</p>
