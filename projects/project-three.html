        <h2>Balsa Wood Bridge</h2>
        <p class="justify"> As a final project for my <strong>Introduction to the Mechanics of Solids course</strong>, we were tasked with building a small scale bridge capable of withstanding 45lbs of weight.
        This was a competition amongst the students, and our bridge was capable of carrying the most. Our bridge was capable of holding the 45lbs weight with ease, so as a challenge we asked a few of the 
        students to hang from it. We worked our way up in weight until we reached <strong>over 225lbs</strong>. At this point, the glue used to join the wood gave out, and the bridge broke. After 
        the class, Professor Vlassak approached my team and informed us that our bridge was one of the best he had seen, and was confident that, had the glue not failed, <strong>we could have
        supported upwards of 300lbs.</strong> This was a great thing to hear, considering the amount of time and effort we had put into this design. </p>

        <p class="justify"> Our bridge featured an array of design principles. We included a mixture of Warren and Pratt Truss designs, to account for both tension and compression, as well as utilized Tension strings, running tip to tip, to provide a 
        catenary-like tension element, helping to counteract any upward deflection caused by the added weight. Finally, we included cross bracing along the horizontal of the bridge to 
        prevent any side-sway or torsional buckling. Overall, our bridge was designed to <strong>resist bending, buckling and torsion </strong> thanks to the combination of different engineering principles.
