        <p class="justify">The final project for my Electrical Engineering course. We were given creative freedom to build whatever we wanted within the scope of the course. 
        It just so happened that I was in KungFu Tea the night before, where I was taken aback by the seemningly floating images of their bubble tea in the corner 
        of the restaurant - so I knew that was what I wanted to build. This project left me fulfilled, as it explored an array of different (and some new) engineering
        conecepts.
        <br><br>
        During this project, I designed the mechanism using solidworks, ensuring space for the battery to be mounted to the fan (to avoid any tangling). Furthermore, full code was written from 
        scratch that allowed any image to be uploaded and instantly mapped on this 1D LED display. The code had to calculate what RGB to display at a specific time, given its position on the rod, as well as the rotational speed.
