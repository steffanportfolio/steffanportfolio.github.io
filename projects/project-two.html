        <p>The final project for my Electrical Engineering course, we were given creative freedom to build whatever we wanted, within the scope of the course. 
        It just so happened that I was in KungFu Tea the night before, where I was taken aback by the seemningly floating images of their bubble tea in the corner 
        of the restaurant - so I knew that was what I wanted to build. This project left me fulfilled, as it explored an array of different (and some new) engineering
        conecepts.</p>
